# SimplePaint
Program to randomly generate circles, triangles and lines to be painted in a canvas, with the option to 'repaint', which will generate a new canvas.
# Motivation
This program was a classroom project that I thoroughly enjoyed.
# Build Status
The project is officially complete, however there are some features that I would like to add in the future.
# Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the canvases that were created using the program.

# Possible Future Features
I would like to add the option to create and save a screenshot of the canvas.
I would also like to add more shapes that could be generated.
